## Conclusion

The exploratory data analysis (EDA) provided a comprehensive overview of the dataset, revealing critical patterns and relationships among key variables. We identified several notable trends and correlations, which offer valuable insights for further analysis. The quality of the data was evaluated, uncovering aspects that need cleaning or preprocessing. These insights lay the groundwork for developing predictive models and guide future analytical efforts. The next steps involve addressing the data issues identified and leveraging these findings to inform more advanced analysis.
